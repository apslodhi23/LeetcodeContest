It was an implementation question in which for depositing, 
I added the notes in the available notes array and for withdrawal,
Checked whether we can withdraw the amount using largest denomination. 
For this I have subtracted the largest donomination (which is smaller or equal to amount) 
from the amount and repeated this process util the amount become 0 or there is no denomination 
less than or equal to amount the and atlast if the amount become 0 the returned the vector of withdrawing 
note else return -1;

SOLUTION:-



class ATM {
public:
    long long  no[5]={0};
    long long amo[5]={20,50,100,200,500};
    ATM() {
        
    }
    void deposit(vector<int> arr) {
      for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
          no[i]+=arr[i];
      }
    }
    
    vector<int> withdraw(int am) {
        vector<int >ans(5,0);
        vector<long long>ck(5);
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            ck[i]=no[i];
 
        }
            for(int i=4;i>=0;i--){
                if(am<amo[i]){
                    continue;
                }else{
                    long long k=no[i];
                    long long c=am/amo[i];
                    ans[i]=min(c,k);
                    no[i]-=min(c,k);
                    am-=(min(c,k)*amo[i]);
                }
            }
        if(am!=0){
            for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            no[i]=ck[i];
        }
            return {-1};
        }
        return ans;
        // }
    }
};

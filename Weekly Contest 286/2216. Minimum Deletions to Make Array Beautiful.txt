*My code During live contest / optimised code *

class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletion(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans=0;
        int i=0;
        int n=nums.size();
	
	//My intution was to remove all the right adjacent elements of even index which 
	//are same as the value of that index. And Even after doing the same, 
	//if the length of string has became odd then I decreasad the size of string by 1.
	
        while(i<n){
		// checking weather the next number is eual to current or not
		// if it is not same we will increamnt i to i+2 so that i iterate only on even index
		// if it is same we will remove all the number that are right adjecent to that number and ar equal
		
            if(i<n-1 and nums[i]!=nums[i+1]){
                i+=2;
            }else{
                int j=i+1;
                while(j<n and nums[i]==nums[j]){
                    j++;
                }
                j--;
		// the removed elements will be j-i
                ans+=j-i;

                j++;
                i=j;
                i++;
            }
        }
// if the string after removing is of odd length we will reomove one more element from the string
        if((n-ans)%2==1){
            ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Time Complexity :- o(n);
